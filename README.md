This repository demonstrates an uncommon Groovy bug related to handling null and empty string inputs in method parameters.  The `bug.groovy` file contains code that showcases the issue. The `bugSolution.groovy` demonstrates a robust solution.  The issue stems from the implicit coercion in Groovy and how it might lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered when dealing with nulls and empty strings. Solutions involve explicit null and empty checks.
